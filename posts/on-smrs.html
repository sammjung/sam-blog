                <h1>On SMRs</h1>
                <div class="post-date">March 19, 2024</div>
                <p>Trump recently put out a few EO's on nuclear power as part of his National Energy Dominance Strategy. I have strong feelings about this. Though there's been a ton of recent industry investment into Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) to the tune of $10B, one of their biggest issues is regulatory -- SMRs generate 30x more nuclear waste than traditional reactors. There are ways to safely reprocess/reuse up to 96% of this waste again to generate even more energy, but the NRC banned it indefinately in 1977 for political reasons/nuclear scares. This EO reverses this, so it's big for the nuclear industry (reduces cost, sustainability, etc..). It's also why you saw nuclear stocks jump 40-80% in the past week.</p>
                <p>Nuclear/fusion are probably the only ways we will be able to sustainably power data centers in the future without completely killing the planet. This is one of the best EOs Trump has put out since taking office, and I'm very excited for what's to come.</p>
