                <em>I've been learning to read the news again. Beyond reading for content, I'm trying to pay more attention to how people write. If to write is to think, then to read is to learn. Remember when "global warming" was still a term, and now the media calls it "climate change?" That was an effort led by Frank Luntz, a pollster and former strategist for Bush. Since then, Luntz has lost his home to a forest fire, and has stepped back on this position—admitting that the climate scientists were right. I hate people like Luntz, who ignore problems. I'd like to use this blog to highlight the problems I see.</em>
